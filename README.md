## About me
I'm a software developer, magician, footballer (GAA), nature and science enthusiast, cocktail fan, Irish speaker (labhair Gaeilge liom) and I try to create things that I would like to use or see out in the world.

### Active Projects
- Tuigim
-- Tuigim is a Twitter bot that tweets out a proverb every morning and a curse every evening. All tweet are done in Irish and English, and I'm currently working with artists to illustrate some of the ones I would like to see their take on. Checkout @Tuigim_ie on Twitter and Instagram.
- The Kitchen Table
-- [The Kitchen Table](http://thekitchentable.ie) is a small directory of independant Irish Businesses and Bookshops that I coallated during lockdowns in a bid to direct people to them instead of Am*zon 
- An PoitigÃ©ir
-- A Cocktail App/Blog that supports Irish and English, allows the user to sign-up, select the ingredients that they have and check out the drinks they can make. Not yet officially launched.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a simple cocktail app/website which is almost ready.
